# Caeser-Cipher-
This is a simple Caeser Cipher program that I built in python. The program works on a shift of three on the ascii table. It works by having the user entering whether or not they would like to encrypt or decrypt a message. They then enter the message and the program will find the ascii value of each character and then add that ascii value plus three into an empty string. Decrypt works in the reverse by subtracting three instead of adding it. There are limitations such as it will not decrypt spacing correctly and in its current state it will not encrypt/decrypt numbers.
